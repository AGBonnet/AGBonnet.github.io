The Memory Palace

I. Along the corridor

An invitation to madness inscribed on a luminous mirror;
I watch my thousand-fold image on both sides stretching
as the ringing voice of a hunch-backed woman
reaches me with steady rhythm, pulsating, prowling

Her ancient face buried among deep furs,
knots of fingers dissimulate a golden key
and by a mute word orders me to follow
Along a corridor adorned with familiar sights;

A printing press oozing with black goo
An artificial greenhouse, its earth bearing
the unspeakable scars of an unruly beast
Crying mandragoras, pulled by their tuberculosis hair
A guitar lesson for mechanical girls, undeserving
An ornate clock rewound by blindfolded Fate

One grotesque idea standing amidst
a lavish interior of crimson cushions
‘See that red wine stain on her shirt?’
Bitemarks on an unripe fruit pleasing unknown people

Screeches, vain outpourings
of abandoned silence and laborious love
hiding behind gauzes of silky smoke
— ‘Back to the gate please’

Led by the arm into a green room, dimly lit
In its midst sits an antique oak wardrobe,
heavy and unmoving. Its mouth welcomes the key
unwillingly offered by my companion

Squealing under the strain, the door revolves
and swallows me whole in its acid smile
Inside, a warm cocoon of fur coats and ankle-deep snow
reveals a strange land where memories lie

II. A walk through the woods

Among great pine trees toiling under heavy snow,
a punctured membrane seeps a rare honey
that a gluttonous bear seeks to lick
clawing its way among the canopy. Its ravenous appetite satisfied
until viscous paws betray its blundering descent
No soft trees to break the fall — and its neck hangs, broken

Beneath the Sun burning all
but the children of its unconstrained folly,
injuries of old imprinted on the bark of a willow tree
Between its roots, twisting and turning, unravelling time
a glance reveals two drops of blood distilled in the snow

As I approach, they vanish into that albino glint
of slippery anxiety, perspiring cortisol, heart pulsating anxiously
Before my searching fingers can brush its drenched coat
it leaps in a dark hole, sinking ever-downwards

Denied entrance, my path slumps down to marshes
flooded with unctuous petrol, its surface boiling
with leeches biting their own tail, primal fear awakened
and in the vast clearing, a towering mansion stands, waiting

A gondolier caught in vast flowery drapes,
reveals its round mechanical eye leaking poppy tears
Clasped to his neck an hourglass, red sand flowing upward
and six fingers guide me into an icy barge
— ‘Onto the black Sea we ride’

III. In the flooded Palace

Expulsed on marble steps flushed by a dark liquid
They squeal under my feet and rouse the guard awake
Framed by pillars, crowned with nails,
milky eyes laughing out at me
and two fingers point above the doorway

There, a confused blotter of bloody mucous;
‘In the inner chambers of your mind,
that is where a well-hidden game
awaits us both for play’

My gaze crosses the guard’s own
as he rolls to the viscous floor,
shaken by grief and glee alike,
granting passage to a draped antechamber

Received by a self-absorbed hostess
peering through a rack of human skin-suits
rippling like odorous clothes drying in sunlight
‘Proper attire required’ says the sign

Now undressed I penetrate the hall;
infinite expanses of towering columns,
soaring unto grimy arches like upturned smirks
above narrow-eyed windows spying

On a banquet table laid with pomegranate carcasses
and all around, the delicate hum of bees
devouring the remains of this fleshy feast,
solving the algebra of need
like lovers on a red-stained bed

My reverie interrupted by the needle of a vicious slave
who’d mistaken my scorched heart
for the overripe fruit of a repressed breast
Pain looms low like a bird of prey,
my eyes plucked by its cruel claws
and blindly I rush forward

To an inner courtyard, flora flaring all about
A glassy ceiling ensnares its fertile womb
pregnant with exotic plants and small furry animals
In its bowels, a twisted labyrinth of cypress trees

Along the muddy ground, strange horned arrows
suggest the way through these sinuous entrails

Seeking relief, I sink ever deeper until —
in a dark bend, two horizontal pupils prying avidly;
a capricious leer reflected on its familiar face, caught
unaware of the stamps leading to its cleft hooves

The hunter hunted and innocence bared
vanishes in a convulsion of leaves
Dogging its abrupt flight, I fall into a clearing;
there lies unwitting prey to twisted fancy

At the heart of the maze, a sight lingers;
in a shallow pond, starry-eyed Leda
strangling the abominable swan
with a white silk ribbon — peace at last

My senses, drowned in contemplation
of earthly cravings silenced, are awakened
by the sweet smell of sizzling meat
spurring me away absentminded

To a glistening body in a bronze cauldron,
its belly licked by fiery tongues
dancing gleefully along an Incan witch
howling pagan cries over the steaming broth

Her chest, hard and brown,
Rises with the midnight Sun
And falls with the morning tide;
‘A spoonful cures the ache’

Relieved of that pressing vulture
By the soft grip of thirst quenched
After a final stretch of grassy walls,
a round, tarnished door left ajar,
perturbed by a hurried frenzy
of dense vapor, warm and inviting

IV. Through the Bathhouse

Bitter sights lurk among foggy memories
Among an immaculate hall of Victorian baths,
a doll with steel hair seized by spasms,
run through by an electric current

Grasping for the end of a candle,
her varnished skin cracking at the seam,
unaware of that magnificent beast
of clear gaze, looking

Producing vanities, vanilla clots of acrid
sweetness, silent among the many
impatient onlookers, silhouetted against
the heavy mist bound by a glassy ceiling

Swallowed by the haze, I walk
among the columns naked
A finger’s touch
then a hand
and its laughing eyes
lead me through
great lumps of human flesh,
abdominal cathedrals coupling
a flood of legs glistening, hinting, undulating softly

In a black pool, the sunken gate
wrought of interlocked iron arms
unveils the mirror-clad Empress
bathing in gazes, bound to drown

Vaseline in a mask mold; the archeology of vanity
Unravelling ruins from living flesh
The sweet smell of folly surrounded her
— impossible to ignore

Unseen and seeing, a smiling cipher
suggests a very delicate form of torture
She had a knowing look about her
until, engulfed by perpetual apnea,
she drowned in newfound sleep

Instantly, its liquid surface came to rest 
and a shard of light leaped on its smooth mercury hind 
as a strange hiss pervaded the air, calling 
blindly I pressed onwards to reach it
warm dew now scalding steam

And under its damp cloak, a twisted riddle;
the dying gush of an exit sign illuminated 
the unsightly flanks of a puzzled Sphinx, 
one head deaf — the other mute

Her question yet unasked, lingering still
over a bed of snakes coiled around regal paws
shielding a shallow breach in the tiled walls
‘Listen to the quiet voice and tell me’ 
‘The way out is through’

V. Up the Stairs

Rushing; a violent wave of sound and color
Cheering spurts of tongues unknown filled the lobby 
a hive overflowing with blood-tinged honey
Feverish limbs sprouting from a chaotic crowd 
massed under countless concentric balconies 

pulsating with choirs of jubilant screams
all faces were raised to a thorny revolving chandelier 
hanging from a towering glass dome, hornets’ nest
stirred by the distant vibration of a deafening roar

Artificial light drifted over a night sea of bent necks, 
sinuous hips, clutched ribs, twisted spines viscous with sweat
bodies compressed under impossible pressure, rain-soaked,
protruding at awkward angles against the strangled laughter 
of waxy faces spattered like vitiligo stains 

Hysteria pulsated with the endless rhythm of drums 
thumping as one synchronised heartbeat
The air pierced by the frenzied prongs of jazz 
and golden trumpets blaring synthetic joy

Over a saturnalia of various exotic specimens 
displayed all about, knowingly caged 
in a nocturnal dance among velvet drapes 
and the distinct smell of yearning;

A web-fingered eunuch swallowing a live eel 
A blind archer parading victorious (his very own William Tell act)
A masked baroness exposing fanged lips 
A formaldehyde minotaur drifting in a glass basin

bacchus and his bared wine-stained teeth 
gloating over abandoned ivory necks, leashed
Identical twins juggling with white-hot coals 
An avid crowd massed under a child suspended in mid-air, 
sobbing absinth drops over their writhing tongues

I clamber up the narrow staircase, its walls adorned 
with piss stains and tapestries weaved in tales of war, 
stepping over the drunken rubbles of lust 
and discarded heaps of half-consumed hatred

at every level, the convulsive rumble grew louder 
and the crowd denser, more violent, starved 
oblivious to The Intruder, rabid lips gleaming with white tar 
in the sway dance of animalistic jealousy

Upon a landing, straggling lovers separated from the mass
— held in her harms, he negotiates with her grinning belt,
offering their pliable flesh of dissent on the altar
to espouse the wave of digital catatonia

caressing the weight of estranged eyes
no stable words can quench this gentle thrust
‘Their twitchings and mutterings 
are thought to be of prophetic significance’

All abound to see the silicone maiden and her savaged breast;
a uniform of human skin betrayed by lousy needlework 
And the war cry of infinite sequences sharp as razors
burrowing the skin to sing their vitriolic choir
‘All aboard my spine! Let us ride eternal
on the endless accretion of meanings unknown’

On the final floor; massed under the moonlit dome 
chaos thundering over a circular courtroom, 
an autodafé of ecstatic Javanese mouths gaping at you
the overturned martyr, levitating over a central pit

Pierced by porcupine quills, 
its ivory bosom leaks pearly droplets
from the gash a keyhole to the blue eye
afraid that it would ever close I leap to you
and the world turns upside down around us
the bottom of the toppled tower our nest
our eyes shall never lock again
