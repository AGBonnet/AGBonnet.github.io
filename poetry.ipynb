    "Idea for the website: Make the user click anywhere, and the words of the poem appear randomly on the page. Maybe make them move to their place from a random position, or simply make them light up like a network of meanings (guirlande). Might make the words network by taking minimum cos similarity of word embeddings, then propagating in waves from the root, or normalize embeddings then take nearest neighbors in waves. (sort in increasing order of distance from the root). When the user hovers on a word, this becomes the new root and scrolling down reveals the words from the root. "
