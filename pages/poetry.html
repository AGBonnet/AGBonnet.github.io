    <div class="stanza">
      <h2 class="line">I. Along the Corridor</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">An invitation to madness inscribed on a luminous mirror;</p>
      <p class="line">I watch my thousand-fold image on both sides stretching</p>
      <p class="line">as the ringing voice of a hunch-backed woman </p>
      <p class="line">reaches me with steady rythm, pulsating, prowling</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Her ancient face buried among deep furs, </p>
      <p class="line">knots of fingers dissimulate a golden key</p>
      <p class="line">and by a mute word orders me to follow </p>
      <p class="line">Along a corridor adorned with familiar sights;</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">A printing press oozing with black goo</p>
      <p class="line">An artificial greenhouse, its earth bearing</p>
      <p class="line">the unspeakable scars of an unruly beast</p>
      <p class="line">Crying mandragoras, pulled by their tuberculosis hair</p>
      <p class="line">A guitar lesson for mechanical girls, undeserving</p>
      <p class="line">An ornate clock rewound by blindfolded Fate</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">One grotesque idea standing amidst</p>
      <p class="line">a lavish interior of crimson cushions</p>
      <p class="line">‘See that red wine stain on her shirt?’</p>
      <p class="line">Bitemarks on an unripe fruit pleasing unknown people</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Screeches, vain outpourings</p>
      <p class="line">of abandoned silence and laborious love</p>
      <p class="line">hiding behind gauzes of silky smoke</p>
      <p class="line">— ‘Back to the gate please’</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Led by the arm into a green room, dimly lit</p>
      <p class="line">In its midst sits an antique oak wardrobe,</p>
      <p class="line">heavy and unmoving. Its mouth welcomes the key</p>
      <p class="line">unwillingly offered by my companion</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Squealing under the strain, the door revolves</p>
      <p class="line">and swallows me whole in its acid smile</p>
      <p class="line">Inside, a warm cocoon of fur coats and ankle-deep snow</p>
      <p class="line">reveals a strange land where memories lie</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;" class="line">II. A walk through the woods</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Among great pine trees toiling under heavy snow, </p>
      <p class="line">a punctured membrane seeps a rare honey </p>
      <p class="line">that a gluttonous bear seeks to lick</p>
      <p class="line">clawing its way among the canopy. Its ravenous appetite satisfied </p>
      <p class="line">until viscous paws betray its blundering descent</p>
      <p class="line">No soft trees to break the fall — its neck hangs, broken</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Beneath the Sun burning all</p>
      <p class="line">but the children of its unconstrained folly, </p>
      <p class="line">injuries of old imprinted on the bark of a willow tree</p>
      <p class="line">Between its roots, twisting and turning, unravelling time</p>
      <p class="line">a glance reveals two drops of blood distilled in the snow</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">As I approach, they vanish into that albino glint </p>
      <p class="line">of slippery anxiety, perspiring cortisol, heart pulsating anxiously</p>
      <p class="line">Before my searching fingers can brush its drenched coat </p>
      <p class="line">it leaps in a dark hole, sinking ever-downwards</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Denied entrance, my path slumps down to marshes</p>
      <p class="line">flooded with unctuous petrol, its surface boiling</p>
      <p class="line">with leeches biting their own tail, primal fear awakened</p>
      <p class="line">and in the vast clearing, a towering mansion stands, waiting</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">A gondolier caught in vast flowery drapes, </p>
      <p class="line">reveals its round mechanical eye leaking poppy tears</p>
      <p class="line">Clasped to his neck an hourglass, red sand flowing upward</p>
      <p class="line">and six fingers guide me into an icy barge </p>
      <p class="line">— ‘Onto the black Sea we ride’</p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;" class="line">III. In the flooded Palace</h2>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Expulsed on marble steps flushed by a dark liquid </p>
      <p class="line">They squeal under my feet and rouse the guard awake</p>
      <p class="line">Framed by pillars, crowned with nails, </p>
      <p class="line">milky eyes laughing out at me</p>
      <p class="line">and two fingers point above the doorway</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">There, a confused blotter of bloody mucous;</p>
      <p class="line">‘In the inner chambers of your mind,</p>
      <p class="line">that is where a well-hidden game</p>
      <p class="line">awaits us both for play’</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">My puzzled gaze crosses the guard’s own</p>
      <p class="line">as he rolls to the viscous floor, </p>
      <p class="line">shaken by grief and glee alike, </p>
      <p class="line">granting passage to a draped antechamber</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Received by a self-absorbed hostess</p>
      <p class="line">peering through a rack of human skin-suits </p>
      <p class="line">rippling like odorous clothes drying in sunlight</p>
      <p class="line">‘Proper attire required’ says the sign</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">Now undressed I penetrate the hall;</p>
      <p class="line">infinite expanses of towering columns,  </p>
      <p class="line">soaring unto grimy arches like upturned smirks </p>
      <p class="line">above narrow-eyed windows spying </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">On a banquet table laid with pomegranate carcasses</p>
      <p class="line">and all around, the delicate hum of bees  </p>
      <p class="line">devouring the remains of this fleshy feast,</p>
      <p class="line">solving the algebra of need </p>
      <p class="line">like lovers on a red-stained bed</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line">My reverie interrupted by the needle of a vicious slave</p>
      <p class="line">who’d mistaken my scorched heart</p>
      <p class="line">for the overripe fruit of a repressed breast</p>
      <p class="line">Pain looms low like a bird of prey,</p>
      <p class="line">my eyes plucked by its cruel claws</p>
      <p class="line">and blindly I rush forward </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> To an inner courtyard, flora flaring all about </p>
      <p class="line"> A glassy ceiling ensnares its fertile womb </p>
      <p class="line"> pregnant with exotic plants and small furry animals </p>
      <p class="line"> In its bowels, a twisted labyrinth of cypress trees </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> Along the muddy ground, strange horned arrows  </p>
      <p class="line"> suggest the way through these sinuous entrails </p>
      <p class="line"> Seeking relief, I sink ever deeper until — </p>
      <p class="line"> in a dark bend, two horizontal pupils prying avidly; </p>
      <p class="line"> a capricious leer etched on its familiar face, caught </p>
      <p class="line"> unaware of the stamps leading to its cleft hooves </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> The hunter hunted and innocence bared  </p>
      <p class="line"> vanishes in a convulsion of leaves </p>
      <p class="line"> Dogging its abrupt flight, I fall into a clearing; </p>
      <p class="line"> there lies unwitting prey to twisted fancy </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> At the heart of the maze, a mirage lingers; </p>
      <p class="line"> in a shallow pond, starry-eyed Leda  </p>
      <p class="line"> strangling the abominable swan  </p>
      <p class="line"> with a white silk ribbon — peace at last </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> My senses, drowned in contemplation  </p>
      <p class="line"> of earthly cravings silenced, are awakened </p>
      <p class="line"> by the sweet smell of sizzling meat </p>
      <p class="line"> spurring me away absentminded </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> To a glistening body in a bronze cauldron, </p>
      <p class="line"> its belly licked by fiery tongues  </p>
      <p class="line"> dancing gleefully along an Incan witch </p>
      <p class="line"> howling pagan cries over the steaming broth</p>

      <p class="line"> Her chest, hard and brown,</p>
      <p class="line"> Rises with the midnight Sun </p>
      <p class="line"> And falls with the morning tide; </p>
      <p class="line"> ‘A spoonful cures the ache’ </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> Relieved of that pressing vulture </p>
      <p class="line"> By the soft grip of thirst quenched </p>
      <p class="line"> After a final stretch of grassy walls,</p>
      <p class="line"> a round, tarnished door left ajar,  </p>
      <p class="line"> perturbed by a hurried frenzy </p>
      <p class="line"> of dense vapor, warm and inviting </p>

      <h2 style="margin-top: 100px;" class="line">IV. Through the Bathhouse</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> Bitter sights often lurk among foggy memories</p>
      <p class="line"> Among an immaculate hall of Victorian baths,</p>
      <p class="line"> a doll with steel hair seized by spasms,</p>
      <p class="line"> run through by an electric current </p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> Grasping for the end of a candle, </p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="line"> Producing vanities, vanilla clots of acrid </p>
      <p class="line"> sweetness, silent among the many </p>

      <p class="line"> great lumps of human flesh, </p>

      <p class="line"> At once rushed a violent wave of sound and color </p>
      <p class="line"> Cheering spurts of foreign tongues filled the lobby </p>

      <p class="line"> Hysteria was ruled by the eternal rhythm of drums</p>
